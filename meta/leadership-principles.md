# LeaderShip Principles

## S.T.A.R. Format

\======> Situation -> Task -> Action -> Result

## Things To Talk About:

* **@BITS**
  * DTN project
  * Apriori project
* **@BARC**
  * Office Management System
  * Telephone Directory
* **@Nestaway**
  * Linguini
* **@Rzp**
  * Mozart: integration + test\_coverage
  * Capital: instant loans, instant refunds, KYC integration
  * OTP-elf
* **@Flipkart**
  * <mark style="color:red;">**Sampling**</mark>
    * **Problem statement**&#x20;
      * With the increasing scale of traffic + features, compute & storage requirements are increasing, and getting machines for them has become difficult and we are heading towards a dead-end, where our batch pipelines would not be able to meet any SLAs in the future.&#x20;
      * For big sale events like BBD 2021 where scale will increase multiple folds, we are seeing huge risk in providing data to our consumers in any defined SLA.&#x20;
      * To address along with various optimizations we have to look upon approaches that can bring down our compute+storage requirements and still meet consumer expectations with a certain degree of accuracy.&#x20;
      * Let's take the example of our Neo Merch/Common Pipeline:
        1. Current compute asks: 20 TB (M3 Data Capacity Ask 2021)
        2. Available reserved Compute: 9 TB 3. Dependency on bursting: 50%
        3. Expected BBD 2021 ask: 28 TB
        4. After Optimization BBD2021 ask would become: 22 TB
    * **About Sampling:**
      * The whole tech community is marching towards a direction to make insight available as soon as possible with certain guaranteed accuracy and sampling is the key there.
      * In place of doing a process with 100% data, we should <mark style="color:yellow;">work on a random sample of whole data and project numbers with acceptable accuracy.</mark>&#x20;
      * This will reduce our capacity asks multiple folds for example of Neo Pipeline. If we consider 40% as the sample size of the universe then compute requirement will come down by 50%.
    * <mark style="color:orange;">**Metrics (Complete Data)**</mark>: views, clicks, spent, ctr, non-clicks engagements.&#x20;
    * <mark style="color:orange;">**Metrics (Sampled Data):**</mark> served impressions, wins, loaded impressions, win rate, serving efficiency, view rate.
    * Sampling in all the input raw events will be done on <mark style="color:orange;">**requestID**</mark>.&#x20;
      * &#x20;<mark style="color:yellow;">Sampling bucket = hash(requestID) % No of buckets</mark>
    * **IMPACT (@BBD21)**
      * Runtime Improvements&#x20;
        * Avg job <mark style="color:orange;">runtime reduced by</mark> <mark style="color:orange;"></mark><mark style="color:orange;">**60%**</mark> from 40 mins daily avg to 16 mins daily avg..
        * Avg of <mark style="color:orange;">Total Map tasks time of job</mark> is reduced by <mark style="color:orange;">68.9%</mark> from 106 mins to 33 mins.&#x20;
        * Avg of <mark style="color:orange;">Total Reduce tasks time</mark> of job is reduced by <mark style="color:orange;">80.7%</mark> from 117 mins to 22 mins.&#x20;
        * Because of less data to process due to sampling, the <mark style="color:orange;">number of reducers required in fact MR job</mark> has also been reduced by <mark style="color:orange;">half</mark> (350 to 175 now).
    * computation reduced by 80%
    * real impact during BBD sale 21

\====================================================================

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">ü§® ->WHY DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE FLIPKART?</mark>

* \==>&#x20;
  * I am a <mark style="color:orange;">growth oriented person who is yet to find my niche</mark>. Continuing here would lock me in data-side which I feel is too early to settle.
  * I <mark style="color:orange;">love</mark> what I was working on and the <mark style="color:orange;">team I've grown with</mark>, the <mark style="color:orange;">work and the culture were great</mark>. You simply feel like it's time for you to grow different skills and learn from new people, you've heard great things about the <mark style="color:orange;">culture and challenges at X and couldn't be more excited to be part of the team</mark>.
  * (<mark style="color:orange;">team switch</mark> is easier said than allowed)
  * When recruiters ask you why you‚Äôre leaving you don‚Äôt have to state your reason but you can reply with what you‚Äôre looking for. For instance you can say I‚Äôm looking to work in a product company, or a company that involves X. In other words tell them what you‚Äôre looking for, never why you‚Äôre leaving. That way you don‚Äôt have to involve your current employer.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">ü§® -> WHY DO YOU WANT TO JOIN UBER?</mark>

* \==>&#x20;
  * Uber has been my dream company since college days.
    * since first job; I've been regular reader/visitor of **uber engg blogs.**&#x20;
    * It has shaped me as an engineer
  * My mom uses it. (It saved my uncle's life @4am)&#x20;
  * So, when Uber's **recruiter reached out**; I could not have not applied here! & <mark style="color:orange;">couldn't be more excited to be part of the team</mark>.
  * (looking at the **stocks**; its the right time to get some of'em üòã)
  * Uber‚Äôs mission statement is ‚Äú**Transportation as reliable as running water, everywhere for everyone**.‚Äù&#x20;

* typecast mismatch from Java's List to Sark's Wrapped Array
  * WrappedArray wraps an Array to give it extra functionality. It also have a bunch of types while array extends only serializable and cloneable, This allows an array to be wrapped so it can be used in places where some generic collection type like Seq is required.
* CORRECTIVE MEASURES:
  * fixed the bug in one night(during sale oncall) collaborating with the ingestion team & serving team
  * (post fix)published Detailed RCA in tech-session withdebugging steps &
  * increased learning of spark & how spark's typecasting work

\==================================================================

**1. Why do you want to quit your current job ?**

* The job is becoming more data-engineering intensive; as things are progressing in the ecosystem.But I dont want to switch the domain from Software Developer to completely DE. -> this was the key factor I decided to start looking out.
* and unable to switch teams due to internal policies.
* <mark style="color:green;">not learning anything new as product is in a saturated state,</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">NEVER EVER talk about bad boss, politics etc - it will backfire bigtime.</mark>

**2.What has been the biggest failure of your career till now ? OR What is the most critical feedback received from your boss in your entire career ?**

* \*\*WHAT: \*\*brand & category enrichment in BSS
  * new platform | first time occurence during the Independence Day Sale
  * typecast mismatch from Java's **`List`** to Sark's **`Wrapped Array`**
    * `WrappedArray` wraps an `Array` to give it extra functionality. It also have a bunch of types while array extends only serializable and cloneable, This allows an array to be wrapped so it can be used in places where some generic collection type like `Seq` is required.
* **CORRECTIVE MEASURES:**
  * fixed the bug in one night(during sale oncall) collaborating with the ingestion team & serving team
  * (post fix)
  * published Detailed RCA in tech-session with
    * debugging steps &
    * increased learning of spark & how spark's typecasting work
  * Implemented the same type-safety in pipeline's code & added UTs for the same
* **IMPACT:**
  * Even though we missed the SLA for the first night of sale(Early Access); we fixed the issue on time for the smoother sale.

***

**3. What would you like to improve at your current workplace ? OR What do you dislike/hate at your current job/workplace ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">a trap - if you badmouth your current employer or use any words like</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**hate**</mark> <mark style="color:green;">or</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**dislike**</mark><mark style="color:green;">, it is guaranteed to go against you.</mark>
* Talk about generic things like -
  * sometimes code reviews take a long time due to senior developers being busy
    * probably that can be streamlined.
  * Or say - we should invest more in enhancing the\*\* test automation infrastructure\*\*, which often takes a backseat due to various constraints
  * (!) too many senior people leaving - has resulted in a knowledge bottleneck
* <mark style="color:green;">Basically, try to stay around technical things, and avoid talking about poor cafeteria or no free cab pickup-drop services etc.</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">The motive is to show your passion towards work related things and not focus on secondary things like cafeteria or cabs or playgrounds etc.</mark>

**4. Are you happy at your current job ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">This is also a big trap.</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">If you talk only about goody-goody positive things, then this question will be immediately followed by -</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**if you like your job, then why are you looking around for another job**</mark><mark style="color:green;">?</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">So, answer it diplomatically around point 1 of this post. Talk about good things like - I have gotten to learn a lot.</mark>
  * Got to explore data side
  * Worked on such big scale
* <mark style="color:green;">Then talk about negatives - again in polished way</mark>
  * Domain shift

**5. What would you do if you find your senior or boss doing something unethical or violating a company policy ?**

Always talk about that you would gently point out to that person directly, and request that person to follow the correct process. In case the violations continue, then I would like to know about the violation reporting policy of your company.

Here, you can turnaround the interview by **cross-questioning** your interviewer - "**by the way, can you give a brief insight into policy violation reporting mechanism which exists in this company ?**"

**6. What is your greatest weakness ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">No, NO, NO - please do not talk about</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**being impatient or pushing your team hard etc etc**</mark><mark style="color:green;">. These are all very very well-known answers.</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">Talk about something more genuine and possibly not related to work -</mark> I am not so good at remembering names of people I interact with for first few times.
* <mark style="color:green;">But be prepared to answer -</mark> **what are you doing to overcome this weakness** ?
* <mark style="color:green;">Possible answers to above examples may be -</mark> **Hi X**, I am using this technique to use the name of the person I am interacting with first time in conversation
