\==> Linguini@Nestaway&#x20;

* 6 months internship; got project in the last 1.5 months&#x20;
* change of 3 mentors caused too much skeweness in POC (spent enough time with image processing, comparing GCP/AWS/Azure, pricing) \\&#x20;
* last 3 weeks remaind; panicked as mentor@college was asking for pre-demo & ppt&#x20;
* improvised & went ahead with speech-to-text + targetted-keywords matching

\==================================================================

## Things To Talk About:

1. @BITS

* DTN project
* Apriori project

1. @BARC

* Office Management System
* Telephone Directory

1. @Nestaway

* Linguini

1. @Rzp

* Mozart: integration
* Capital: instant loans, instant refunds, KYC integration

1. @Flipkart

* Keyword Targeting
* Sampling
  * computation reduced by 80%
  * real impact during BBD sale 21
* Bidding Price Recommendation System
* Ads Merch Separation
* RCAs
* NFRs

#### **1. Why do you want to quit your current job ?**

* The job is becoming more data-engineering intensive; as things are progressing in the ecosystem.But I dont want to switch the domain from Software Developer to completely DE. -> this was the key factor I decided to start looking out.
* and unable to switch teams due to internal policies.
* <mark style="color:green;">not learning anything new as product is in a saturated state,</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">NEVER EVER talk about bad boss, politics etc - it will backfire bigtime.</mark>

#### 2.**What has been the biggest failure of your career till now ?** OR **What is the most critical feedback received from your boss in your entire career ?**

* \*\*WHAT: \*\*brand & category enrichment in BSS
  * new platform | first time occurence during the Independence Day Sale
  * typecast mismatch from Java's **`List`** to Sark's **`Wrapped Array`**
    * `WrappedArray` wraps an `Array` to give it extra functionality. It also have a bunch of types while array extends only serializable and cloneable, This allows an array to be wrapped so it can be used in places where some generic collection type like `Seq` is required.
* **CORRECTIVE MEASURES:**
  * fixed the bug in one night(during sale oncall) collaborating with the ingestion team & serving team
  * (post fix)
  * published Detailed RCA in tech-session with
    * debugging steps &
    * increased learning of spark & how spark's typecasting work
  * Implemented the same type-safety in pipeline's code & added UTs for the same
* **IMPACT:**
  * Even though we missed the SLA for the first night of sale(Early Access); we fixed the issue on time for the smoother sale.

***

#### **3. What would you like to improve at your current workplace ?** OR **What do you dislike/hate at your current job/workplace ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">a trap - if you badmouth your current employer or use any words like</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**hate**</mark> <mark style="color:green;">or</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**dislike**</mark><mark style="color:green;">, it is guaranteed to go against you.</mark>
* Talk about generic things like -
  * sometimes code reviews take a long time due to senior developers being busy
    * probably that can be streamlined.
  * Or say - we should invest more in enhancing the\*\* test automation infrastructure\*\*, which often takes a backseat due to various constraints
  * (!) too many senior people leaving - has resulted in a knowledge bottleneck
* <mark style="color:green;">Basically, try to stay around technical things, and avoid talking about poor cafeteria or no free cab pickup-drop services etc.</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">The motive is to show your passion towards work related things and not focus on secondary things like cafeteria or cabs or playgrounds etc.</mark>

#### 4. **Are you happy at your current job ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">This is also a big trap.</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">If you talk only about goody-goody positive things, then this question will be immediately followed by -</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**if you like your job, then why are you looking around for another job**</mark><mark style="color:green;">?</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">So, answer it diplomatically around point 1 of this post. Talk about good things like - I have gotten to learn a lot.</mark>
  * Got to explore data side
  * Worked on such big scale
* <mark style="color:green;">Then talk about negatives - again in polished way</mark>
  * Domain shift

**5. What would you do if you find your senior or boss doing something unethical or violating a company policy ?**

Always talk about that you would gently point out to that person directly, and request that person to follow the correct process. In case the violations continue, then I would like to know about the violation reporting policy of your company.

Here, you can turnaround the interview by **cross-questioning** your interviewer - "**by the way, can you give a brief insight into policy violation reporting mechanism which exists in this company ?**"

#### **6. What is your greatest weakness ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">No, NO, NO - please do not talk about</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**being impatient or pushing your team hard etc etc**</mark><mark style="color:green;">. These are all very very well-known answers.</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">Talk about something more genuine and possibly not related to work -</mark> I am not so good at remembering names of people I interact with for first few times.
* <mark style="color:green;">But be prepared to answer -</mark> **what are you doing to overcome this weakness** ?
* <mark style="color:green;">Possible answers to above examples may be -</mark> **Hi X**, I am using this technique to use the name of the person I am interacting with first time in conversation
