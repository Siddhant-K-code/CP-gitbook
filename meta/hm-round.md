### News

* Recent news: ShareChat in-talks to buy MX Taka Tak
* Gambhir appeared on ShareChat on KKR-CSK final for QnAs

### Why Want To Join

* Scale- 100M: ShareChat, 160M: Moj
* local support
* India's apetite for content
* peer network: IITs/Startups/FAANG/ICPC etc : learning opportunity

#### 1. Language First Userbase

* only 10% of its population speaks English and the majority of the country‚Äôs internet users are from non-English-speaking rural areas
* users who are new to the internet‚Äîlet alone social media‚Äîdon‚Äôt know how discovery works, especially if they‚Äôre from a low-literacy background.&#x20;
* &#x20;solves that hurdle by bringing the content to them. By tapping into this model, companies like Google and Twitter can expand into territories that were otherwise inaccessible for them, and monetize new users through advertising.
  * ‚ÄúShareChat encompasses a massive following in Tier II, III, and IV cities and towns, one amongst the major reasons to make ShareChat a sought-after outlet for these western tech companies to add into their . . . portfolio,‚Äù
* In the search for their next batch of users, most of them have turned their attention to India, where more people have logged onto the internet for the first time in the last couple of years than the U.S.‚Äôs entire online population
* Resembling Reddit more than Facebook or Twitter, ShareChat doesn‚Äôt make you follow or friend anyone to get going. When you first log in, your home feed will be filled with posts from a wide variety of topics such as news, tabloid gossip, good-morning messages, and more‚Äîall in the local language of your choice.
* biggest difference between ShareChat and other familiar social experiences is that it has no English-language option. That‚Äôs part of what‚Äôs made western tech giants sit up and take notice.
  * Twitter has invested twice(100M recently)
  * rumoured raising more money from Google and Snapchat
  * At one point, talks of Google acquiring ShareChat for a billion dollars surfaced as well.

#### 2. Apetite for Content

* ShareChat is wired to feed off of India‚Äôs soaring appetite for content. It‚Äôs designed to fuel new internet users‚Äô obsession with information, and‚Äîeven more importantly‚Äîtheir proclivity to forward that information on WhatsApp
* On top of that, ShareChat comes equipped with public chat rooms where you can jump in and just start talking to strangers‚Äîa common internet perk that new Indian internet users from underdeveloped regions especially find fascinating. To serve this specific behavior, ShareChat even has a feature called ‚ÄúShake-N-Chat‚Äù that connects two strangers engaging with similar kinds of topics over personal chat.

#### 3. Emerging Indian Market

* India is the second-fastest growing internet economy and hosts over 650 million online users.  Last year, Cisco forecast that this figure would surpass 900 million by 2023.
* Further, since only about half of India‚Äôs population is online‚Äîcompared to the U.S. and the UK where over 90% of people are on the internet‚Äîthere‚Äôs plenty more to come and tech companies can‚Äôt afford to miss out.
* Much of the credit for India‚Äôs digital revolution can be attributed to wireless carrier Reliance Jio, which four years ago began offering cellular 4G services for dirt-cheap prices, forcing the rest of the competition to match the prices in order to survive
* Most of these tech companies have also spent much of the last few years trying to optimize their offerings for India, where the median household income is about $3,600 and the cost of devices and internet service is a major factor in adoption
  * you can talk to the Google Assistant via a toll-free number‚Äîno internet needed.&#x20;
  * Amazon sells a battery-powered Echo smart speaker to cater to the country‚Äôs electricity-deficient regions.&#x20;
  * Facebook, Google, and Twitter offer their apps on inexpensive dumbphones.&#x20;
  * Netflix has a $3 mobile-only plan that lets users stream TV shows and movies in non-HD standard quality on their phones

#### \[Q] 4. Why is there no support for English?

*   ShareChat initially offered an English option, but the founders noticed people who selected it were barely engaging with the service.

    ‚ÄúUsers were choosing English because of their aspirational value, not because of comfort. Indic language users showed the highest levels of engagement,‚Äù says ShareChat cofounder and CEO  Ankush Sachdeva. ‚ÄúThis propelled us to discontinue English and go the Indic language way.‚Äù

#### \[] 5. ShareChat Labs

* new research center in Palo Alto, California
* ShareChat Labs looks to experiment with machine learning technologies to take on the social network‚Äôs most pressing issues like detecting NSFW content, hate speech, and fake news and build infrastructure to power its next-gen products. One of the areas ShareChat is primarily exploring is camera tech for developing familiar social features such as augmented reality experiences, lenses, filters, stickers, live video streaming, and more, for both ShareChat and Moj.

### Ending Questions

* How does ShareChat prevents fake news/hate speech/NSFW content spread?
  * govt's new regulations
  * local languages make it very difficult for any ML model
  * chat-room mods
  * share to whatsapp button, whatsapp being -a significant channel for misinformation in India
* architecture: central teams(sharechat+moj) & new emerging teams(jeet11 & Circle) work totally independently OR do they have shared pool of in-house components which they reuse?
* next initiatives : after Moj, fantasy betting, fashion marketplace(?), ShareChat labs(?); which direction is ShareChat going to be w.r.t. the changing market of India
