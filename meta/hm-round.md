## DONT LIE .......|......... Everything should be in STAR framework

### 1.Situation

### 2.Task

### 3.Action

### 4.Result



## Typical Questions

#### **1. Why do you want to quit your current job ?**

* The job is becoming more data-engineering intensive; as things are progressing in the ecosystem.But I dont want to switch the domain from Software Developer to completely DE. -> this was the key factor I decided to start looking out.
* and unable to switch teams due to internal policies.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">not learning anything new as product is in a saturated state,</mark>&#x20;
* <mark style="color:green;">NEVER EVER talk about bad boss, politics etc - it will backfire bigtime.</mark>

#### 2.**What has been the biggest failure of your career till now ?** OR **What is the most critical feedback received from your boss in your entire career ?**

* **WHAT: **brand & category enrichment in BSS
  * new platform | first time occurence during the Independence Day Sale
  * typecast mismatch from Java's **`List`** to Sark's **`Wrapped Array`**
    * `WrappedArray` wraps an `Array` to give it extra functionality. It also have a bunch of types while array extends only serializable and cloneable, This allows an array to be wrapped so it can be used in places where some generic collection type like `Seq` is required.
*   **CORRECTIVE MEASURES:**

    * fixed the bug in one night(during sale oncall) collaborating with the ingestion team & serving team
    * (post fix)
    * published Detailed RCA in tech-session with&#x20;
      * debugging steps &&#x20;
      * increased learning of spark & how spark's typecasting work
    * Implemented the same type-safety in pipeline's code & added UTs for the same


* **IMPACT:**
  * Even though we missed the SLA for the first night of sale(Early Access); we fixed the issue on time for the smoother sale.

****

#### **3. What would you like to improve at your current workplace ?** OR **What do you dislike/hate at your current job/workplace ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">a trap - if you badmouth your current employer or use any words like</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**hate**</mark> <mark style="color:green;">or</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**dislike**</mark><mark style="color:green;">, it is guaranteed to go against you.</mark>
* Talk about generic things like -&#x20;
  * sometimes code reviews take a long time due to senior developers being busy&#x20;
    * probably that can be streamlined.
  * Or say - we should invest more in enhancing the** test automation infrastructure**, which often takes a backseat due to various constraints
  * (!) too many senior people leaving - has resulted in a knowledge bottleneck
* <mark style="color:green;">Basically, try to stay around technical things, and avoid talking about poor cafeteria or no free cab pickup-drop services etc.</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">The motive is to show your passion towards work related things and not focus on secondary things like cafeteria or cabs or playgrounds etc.</mark>

#### 4. **Are you happy at your current job ?**

* <mark style="color:green;">This is also a big trap.</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">If you talk only about goody-goody positive things, then this question will be immediately followed by -</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**if you like your job, then why are you looking around for another job**</mark><mark style="color:green;">?</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">So, answer it diplomatically around point 1 of this post. Talk about good things like - I have gotten to learn a lot.</mark>
  * Got to explore data side
  * Worked on such big scale
* <mark style="color:green;">Then talk about negatives - again in polished way</mark>
  * Domain shift

**5. What would you do if you find your senior or boss doing something unethical or violating a company policy ?**

Always talk about that you would gently point out to that person directly, and request that person to follow the correct process. In case the violations continue, then I would like to know about the violation reporting policy of your company.

Here, you can turnaround the interview by **cross-questioning** your interviewer - "**by the way, can you give a brief insight into policy violation reporting mechanism which exists in this company ?**"



#### **6. What is your greatest weakness ?** 

* <mark style="color:green;">No, NO, NO - please do not talk about</mark> <mark style="color:green;">**being impatient or pushing your team hard etc etc**</mark><mark style="color:green;">. These are all very very well-known answers.</mark>
* <mark style="color:green;">Talk about something more genuine and possibly not related to work -</mark> I am not so good at remembering names of people I interact with for first few times.
* <mark style="color:green;">But be prepared to answer -</mark> **what are you doing to overcome this weakness** ?
* <mark style="color:green;">Possible answers to above examples may be -</mark> **Hi X**, I am using this technique to use the name of the person I am interacting with first time in conversation\

### News

* Recent news: ShareChat in-talks to buy MX Taka Tak
* Gambhir appeared on ShareChat on KKR-CSK final for QnAs

### Why Want To Join

* Scale- 100M: ShareChat, 160M: Moj
* local support
* India's apetite for content
* peer network: IITs/Startups/FAANG/ICPC etc : learning opportunity

#### 1. Language First Userbase

* only 10% of its population speaks English and the majority of the country’s internet users are from non-English-speaking rural areas
* users who are new to the internet—let alone social media—don’t know how discovery works, especially if they’re from a low-literacy background.&#x20;
* &#x20;solves that hurdle by bringing the content to them. By tapping into this model, companies like Google and Twitter can expand into territories that were otherwise inaccessible for them, and monetize new users through advertising.
  * “ShareChat encompasses a massive following in Tier II, III, and IV cities and towns, one amongst the major reasons to make ShareChat a sought-after outlet for these western tech companies to add into their . . . portfolio,”
* In the search for their next batch of users, most of them have turned their attention to India, where more people have logged onto the internet for the first time in the last couple of years than the U.S.’s entire online population
* Resembling Reddit more than Facebook or Twitter, ShareChat doesn’t make you follow or friend anyone to get going. When you first log in, your home feed will be filled with posts from a wide variety of topics such as news, tabloid gossip, good-morning messages, and more—all in the local language of your choice.
* biggest difference between ShareChat and other familiar social experiences is that it has no English-language option. That’s part of what’s made western tech giants sit up and take notice.
  * Twitter has invested twice(100M recently)
  * rumoured raising more money from Google and Snapchat
  * At one point, talks of Google acquiring ShareChat for a billion dollars surfaced as well.

#### 2. Apetite for Content

* ShareChat is wired to feed off of India’s soaring appetite for content. It’s designed to fuel new internet users’ obsession with information, and—even more importantly—their proclivity to forward that information on WhatsApp
* On top of that, ShareChat comes equipped with public chat rooms where you can jump in and just start talking to strangers—a common internet perk that new Indian internet users from underdeveloped regions especially find fascinating. To serve this specific behavior, ShareChat even has a feature called “Shake-N-Chat” that connects two strangers engaging with similar kinds of topics over personal chat.

#### 3. Emerging Indian Market

* India is the second-fastest growing internet economy and hosts over 650 million online users.  Last year, Cisco forecast that this figure would surpass 900 million by 2023.
* Further, since only about half of India’s population is online—compared to the U.S. and the UK where over 90% of people are on the internet—there’s plenty more to come and tech companies can’t afford to miss out.
* Much of the credit for India’s digital revolution can be attributed to wireless carrier Reliance Jio, which four years ago began offering cellular 4G services for dirt-cheap prices, forcing the rest of the competition to match the prices in order to survive
* Most of these tech companies have also spent much of the last few years trying to optimize their offerings for India, where the median household income is about $3,600 and the cost of devices and internet service is a major factor in adoption
  * you can talk to the Google Assistant via a toll-free number—no internet needed.&#x20;
  * Amazon sells a battery-powered Echo smart speaker to cater to the country’s electricity-deficient regions.&#x20;
  * Facebook, Google, and Twitter offer their apps on inexpensive dumbphones.&#x20;
  * Netflix has a $3 mobile-only plan that lets users stream TV shows and movies in non-HD standard quality on their phones

#### \[Q] 4. Why is there no support for English?

*   ShareChat initially offered an English option, but the founders noticed people who selected it were barely engaging with the service.

    “Users were choosing English because of their aspirational value, not because of comfort. Indic language users showed the highest levels of engagement,” says ShareChat cofounder and CEO  Ankush Sachdeva. “This propelled us to discontinue English and go the Indic language way.”

#### \[] 5. ShareChat Labs

* new research center in Palo Alto, California
* ShareChat Labs looks to experiment with machine learning technologies to take on the social network’s most pressing issues like detecting NSFW content, hate speech, and fake news and build infrastructure to power its next-gen products. One of the areas ShareChat is primarily exploring is camera tech for developing familiar social features such as augmented reality experiences, lenses, filters, stickers, live video streaming, and more, for both ShareChat and Moj.

### Ending Questions

* How does ShareChat prevents fake news/hate speech/NSFW content spread?
  * govt's new regulations
  * local languages make it very difficult for any ML model
  * chat-room mods
  * share to whatsapp button, whatsapp being -a significant channel for misinformation in India
* architecture: central teams(sharechat+moj) & new emerging teams(jeet11 & Circle) work totally independently OR do they have shared pool of in-house components which they reuse?
* next initiatives : after Moj, fantasy betting, fashion marketplace(?), ShareChat labs(?); which direction is ShareChat going to be w.r.t. the changing market of India
