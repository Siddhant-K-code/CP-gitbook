@12Oct21 : beginning of phase2: one month of only prep to crack Uber/Google

### What did I do Wrong in Round#1:

* <mark style="background-color:green;">**DSA**</mark>**: **lack of timed practice
  * Target:
    * \==> EasyQ: < 5 min
    * \==> MediumQ: <10mins
    * \==> HardQ: < 20mins
  * **What to change:**
    * always do questions in timed env(you're through with concepts now; just need to practice)
    * Leetcode's <mark style="background-color:orange;">mock interviews</mark> - free wale
    * "90% of your total LC time should go in Mock Interviews+Past+Contests"
* <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Concurrency**</mark>**:**
  * read up those 2 downloaded books
  * practice ...?
* <mark style="color:red;">**LLD**</mark>**:**
  * I already have the curated list of questions, for each q:Q:
    * code up yourself in 1.5 hr
    * look up other's solutions online & enhance the code
  * keep revising
  * you should be able to code up in TDD format if asked
* <mark style="color:orange;">**HLD:**</mark>
  * long journey ahead!
