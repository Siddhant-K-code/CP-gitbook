# SQL

## NOTES:

* **Group By:**
  * The `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
  * The `GROUP BY` statement is often used with aggregate functions \(`COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`\) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
  * ```sql
    SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
    FROM Customers
    GROUP BY Country;
    ```

    * 
* **Wildcards** in Mysql

| Symbol | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| % | Represents zero or more characters | bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob |
| \_ | Represents a single character | h\_t finds hot, hat, and hit |
| \[\] | Represents any single character within the brackets | h\[oa\]t finds hot and hat, but not hit |
| ^ | Represents any character not in the brackets | h\[^oa\]t finds hit, but not hot and hat |
| - | Represents a range of characters | c\[a-b\]t finds cat and cbt |

* **Like** Operator with wildcards

| Like | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' | Finds any values that start with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' | Finds any values that end with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' | Finds any values that have "or" in any position |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '\_r%' | Finds any values that have "r" in the second position |
| WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o' | Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o" |

* **REGEX**
  * Practiced from [regexone.com](https://regexone.com/lesson/misc_meta_characters?)
  * Using regex in SQL queries: 
    * `select distinct city from station where city` **`regexp`** `'^[aeiou]';`

| Regex | Matches |
| :--- | :--- |
| abc.. | letters |
| 123‚Ä¶ | Digits |
| \d | Any Digit |
| \D | Any Non-digit character |
| . | Any Character |
| \. | Period |
| \[abc\] | Only a, b, or c |
| \[^abc\] | Not a, b, nor c |
| \[a-z\] | Characters a to z |
| \[0-9\] | Numbers 0 to 9 |
| \w | Any Alphanumeric character |
| \W | Any Non-alphanumeric character |
| {m} | m Repetitions |
| {m,n} | m to n Repetitions |
| \* | Zero or more repetitions |
| + | One or more repetitions |
| ? | Optional character |
| \s | Any Whitespace |
| \S | Any Non-whitespace character |
| ^‚Ä¶$ | Starts and ends |
| \(‚Ä¶\) | Capture Group |
| \(a\(bc\)\) | Capture Sub-group |
| \(.\*\) | Capture all |
| \(abc\|def\) | Matches abc or def |
