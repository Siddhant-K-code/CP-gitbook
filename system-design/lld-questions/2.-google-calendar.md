# 2. Google Calendar

## 1.LLD: Functional Requirements:

* book a meeting(one time, recurring)
* send invites to people
* look-up meetings of people
* cancel/modify meetings
* check availability of other people
* send reminder to people
* send rsvp (yes/no/maybe)

## 2.HLD: Non-functional Requirements:

* 1:10 write:read
  * create a meeting & sending an invite => write
  * view/rsvp to an evnet => write
* AP system:
  * Availability is preferred over Consistency

## 3. HLD: Estimations

* User size: 100K
* Low latency
* events/day = 5\*100K = 500K

## 4.HLD: APIs

* <mark style="color:orange;">`[POST] create_event`</mark>`(user_id, event_id, event_content, invitee_list, time_start, duration) `
  * `user_id` : 4 byte => length good enough for 4B users
    * \=> 4\*8 = 32 bits => 2^32 => \~4Billion users
  * `event_id`: 4 byte => 4B
  * `event_content` + `invitee_list`: JSON -> 50 bytes
    * EXCLUDING file attachment for now
  * `time_start`: timestamp: 4byte
  * `duration`: int : 2 byte
  * \==> **TOTAL\_SIZE**: 100 byte
* <mark style="color:orange;">`[GET] read_event`</mark>`(user_id, start_time, duration)`
  * \==> I want to see events starting from Sunday for this week
  * RESPONSE: event\_list\[]
  * \==> **TOTAL\_SIZE**: 100 byte
* <mark style="color:orange;">`[POST] send_rsvp`</mark>`(user_id, event_id, status)`
  * `RESPONSE: null`
* <mark style="color:orange;">\[GET] CheckCalendar(UserId)</mark>
* <mark style="color:orange;">\[PUT] UpdateEvent (EventDetails, List\<UserId>, EventStatus)</mark>
  * Modify
  * Delete

## 4. Data Modelling

```
Event Table
-------------------- event_id : int, PK
-------------------- event_title: varchar(50)
-------------------- event_description: varchar(1000)
-------------------- start_date : timestamp
-------------------- end_date : timestamp
-------------------- is_full_day_event: Boolean
-------------------- created_by : varchar(10)
-------------------- created_date: timetamp
-------------------- invitee_list
-------------------- duration
---------------------------> 5 min/10 min/...8 hrs : a day
---------------------------> 0-40 hrs : a week

RSVP Table
-------------------- event_id
-------------------- user_id
-------------------- rsvp [YES/NO/MAYBE]
```

## 6. Special Cases : Handling Recurring Events

### Two Ways to Manage Recurring Events | [blog](https://www.vertabelo.com/blog/again-and-again-managing-recurring-events-in-a-data-model/)

* NOTE: Handling Recurring Events is a 'tricky' task & there is no white-black ans

### I. The Naive Way❌

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-24 at 3.31.05 AM.png>)

**The Pros:** This is quite a straightforward approach and the simplest to implement.

**The Cons:** The naive way has some significant downsides, including:

* **The need to store all possible instances of an event**. If you are taking the needs of a large user base into account then a large chunk of space is required. However, space is quite cheap, so this point has no major impact.
* **A very messy updating process**. Suppose an event is **rescheduled**. In that case, someone has to update all instances of it. Huge numbers of DML operations need to be performed when rescheduling, which creates a negative impact on application performance.
* **Handling of exceptions**. All exceptions must be handled gracefully, especially if you have to go back and edit the original appointment after making an exception.
  * For example, suppose you move the third instance of a recurring event forward by one day. What if you subsequently edit the time of the original event? **Do you re-insert another event** on the original day and leave the one you brought forward? Unlink the exception? Try to change it appropriately?

### **II. The Expert Way✅**

* **>> **Storing a recurring pattern and generating past and future event instances programmatically
* using <mark style="color:orange;">`start_date`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">,</mark><mark style="color:orange;">`start_time`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">,</mark><mark style="color:orange;">`end_date`</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">,</mark><mark style="color:orange;">`end_time & parent_id`</mark>| **what fucker HM@ShareChat was saying**

* As their names suggest, the <mark style="color:orange;">`start_date`</mark> and <mark style="color:orange;">`end_date`</mark> columns keep the start and end dates of events.&#x20;
  * In the case of regular events, these columns store actual start and end dates.&#x20;
  * However, they also store the dates of the first and last occurrences of periodic events.&#x20;
    * We’ll keep the `end_date` column as nullable, since users can configure recurring events with no end date.&#x20;
    * In this case, future occurrences up to a hypothetical end date (say for a year) would be shown in the UI.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-10-24 at 3.36.24 AM.png>)

* As explained earlier, we will store a recurring pattern for events so that we can construct all its future occurrences. Let’s start by creating the <mark style="color:orange;">**`recurring_pattern`**</mark> table. This table has the following columns:
  * <mark style="color:orange;">Event\_id</mark> – This column is referred from the event table, and it acts as the primary key in this table. It shows the identifying relationship between event and recurring\_pattern tables. This column will also ensure that there is a maximum of one recurring pattern extant for each event.
  * <mark style="color:orange;">Recurring\_type\_id</mark> – This column signifies the type of recurrence, whether it is daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.
  * <mark style="color:orange;">Max\_num\_of\_occurrances</mark> – There are times when we do not know the exact end date for an event but we know how many occurrences (meetings) are needed to complete it. This column stores an arbitrary number that defines the logical end for an event.
  * <mark style="color:orange;">Separation\_count</mark> – You might be wondering how a bi-weekly or bi-yearly event can be configured if there are only four possible recurrence-type values (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly). The answer is the separation\_count column. This column signifies the interval (in days, weeks, or months) before the next event instance is allowed. For example, if an event needs to be configured for every other week, then separation\_count = “1” to meet this requirement. The default value for this column is “0”.

#### Handling Exceptions of Recurring Events : <mark style="color:orange;">**`'event_instance_exception' table`**</mark>

Now let’s come to the exceptions. What if a particular instance of a recurring event is cancelled or rescheduled? All such instances are logged separately in the <mark style="color:orange;">**`event_instance_exception`**</mark> table.

In this table: <mark style="color:orange;">`Is_rescheduled`</mark> and <mark style="color:orange;">`is_cancelled :`</mark>

* These two columns signify whether this instance is rescheduled to some later date/ time or cancelled altogether.
* &#x20;**Why do I have two separate columns for this?**&#x20;
  * Well, just think about events which were first rescheduled and then later completely cancelled.&#x20;
  * This happens, and we have a way of recording it with these columns. \* Aside from these two columns, all remaining columns act the same as in the event table

#### Why link two events by means of parent\_event\_id?

* There are applications which allow users _to reschedule all future instances of a recurring event_.
* In such cases, we have two options.
  * We can store all future instances in `event_instance_exception` (hint: not an acceptable solution).
  * Or we can create a new event with new date/time parameters in the event table and link it with its earlier event (the parent event) by means of the `id_parent_event` column.
    * With this solution, we can get all past occurrences of an event, even when its recurrence pattern has been changed.

#### Complex Cases in case of Recurring Events (to be pointed out during interview)

* Events that occur on holidays. When a particular instance of an event occurs on a public holiday, should it be automatically moved to the working day immediately following the holiday? Or should it be automatically cancelled? In what circumstances would either of these apply?
* Conflicts between events. What if certain events (that are mutually exclusive) fall on the same day?

## 7. HLD: Tips for Scaling

* Cache the imp meetings(stand-ups, team-meetings) for faster look-up
