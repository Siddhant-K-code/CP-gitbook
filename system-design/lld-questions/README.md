## Steps for LLD:

1. create Project in VSCode
2. `Req Gathering` create `design.md` file as ^
3. `Creating Frames` create all the empty classes & their attrs, methods; (some things might change during as interview discussion moves).
    * NOTE: add basic `doc_string` descripiton as many places as you can - leaves good impression
4. `Implementation + UnitTesting` : do your thing. Also introduce abstraction/inheritance etc as per the need.
    * NOTE: Splint the screen & keep `main.py` open on right(along with what you're coding on left) => to continueously checking for bugs & correctness(hence avoinding the rabbit-hole-debugging in the end)
5. `Run + Integration Tests + Edge Cases + Bonus Features`
6. `Writing UTs` : if time permits
```
