#1. Requirement Gathering ======================================
        
        * Functional Requirements:
                1. Users can create account
                2. Users can make posts(photos/text)
                3. Users can follow other users
                4. Users can like+comment on others/self' posts
                        *[?] Comment on a comment? => how many recursion levels(1?)
                        *[?] like a comment?  
                5. Timeline of all those whom user follow
        
        * Non-functional Requirements:
                1. Service is hightly available
                2. The acceptable latency of the system is 200ms for News Feed generation.
                3. Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability), 
                        if a user doesnâ€™t see a photo for a while; it should be fine.
                4. The system should be highly reliable; any uploaded photo or video should never be lost.
        
        * Out of Scope:
                * Notifications?
                        * Push notifications => normal user
                        * Celebrity ===> PULL Notifications  
                * Adding tags to photos
                * searching photos on tags
                * commenting on photos
                * tagging users to photos
                * follow recommendation
        
        
#2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation ============================
        2.1 Scale of System
                * Total Userbase    : 500M
                * Daily Active Users: 1M
                * 2 new photos per user day => 2M new photos per day
        
        2.2 Storage size estimation
                * size of 1 photo = 5MB
                 => Space required per day : 2M*5MB  = 10 TB
                 => Total space required for 10 years = (10 TB )(365)(10) = 36.5 PB
                                                                          ~ 40 PB (accounting dec in camera price)
                
        2.3 CAP Tradeoffs
                * System is read heavy
                * Users can upload as many photos as they want 
                        => Storage management is crucial
                * Low latency is expected while viewing photos
                * Data should be 100% reliable. 
                        If a user uploads a photo, the system will guarantee that it will never be lost.


#3. APIs =======================================================
        1. POST /user/:id :: {userData}      
        2. GET /user/:id 
        3. POST /follow/:followeeID
        4. POST /like/:postID
        5. POST /comment/:parentID
        6. GET  /getFeed
                * Feed Generation Service PRECOMPUTES user's feed "hourly" & stores in cache
                        * Based On:
                        * GET /getUsersFollowedBuy/:userID    => set<userID> 
                        * then-> GET /getPostsByUser/:userID  => set<postID> # N-latest posts by each
        
        
#4. Models : Defining Classes & ER Diagrams======================
        1. User
        2. Post
                * postID(PK,UUID)

#1. Requirement Gathering ======================================
        1.1 Functional Requirements
                * Reserve a parking spot
                * Receive a ticket/receipt
                * Make payment
                * 3 Types of parking spots: Compact, Regular, large
                * Flat pricing for each spot, per hour 
        1.2 NonFunctional Requirements 
                * High consistency (no 2 people should reserve same spot)
                        * Go for Strong Consistency (rather than Eventual Consitency)
                        * Hence RDBMS (ACID transactions)
                * Reads >>> Writes
        1.3 Out of Scope
                * In-house payment system
#2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation ============================
        2.1 Scale of System
                * 10 floors per garage, 200 spots per floors => 2000 spots
                        * => Not applicable for big data
        2.2 Storage size estimation
#3. APIs =======================================================
        3.1 External Endpoints:

#1. Requirement Gathering ======================================
        1.1 Functional Requirements
                * customer Login
                * Given a URL; generte a shorter & unique alias of it: www.short.ly/abc123
                        * [?] length of short url
                * getLongUrl(short_url)
                * Expiry/TTL for each short URL
        1.2 NonFunctional Requirements - Usage Patterns(read heavy/CAP tradeoffs)
                * High Availability (for reads to work)
                * High consistency (to avoid duplicate writes)
                * Short ULR should be unique
        1.3 Out of Scope
                * customized short url
                * analytics
                * API support

#2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation ============================

        2.1 Scale of System
                * New URLs per month(write) = 500 M
                * QPS = 500M/(30*24*60*60) = 200 URLS write per second
                * Read:Write = 100:1
                        => #urls read per month = 500M*100 = 50B
        2.2 Storage size estimation
                * store all ursl for 5 years
                        * => Total urls stored in 5 year = 500M*5*12 = 30B
                * size of single stored obj = 500bit
                        * => total storage reqd = 30B * 500 bit = 15 TB
                * CACHING:
                        * assume 80-20 rule:
                                * i.e. 20% of URLs generate 80% of traffic
                                * cache these 20% hot URLs
                                * cache size per second = 20K*(500bit) = 10MB
                                * => cache size per day = 10MB*24*3600 = 100GB
        2.3 Bandwidht Estimate
                * Incoming(write) req = 200 * 500 bytes = 100 KB/s
                * Outgoing(read) req  = 20K * 500 bytes = 10 MB/s 
                
#3. APIs =======================================================
        * createURL(api_dev_key, original_url, custom_alias=None, user_id=None, expire_date=None)
                * returns short URL string
        * getLongURL(api_dev_key, short_url,user_id) 
                * returns original LONG url string
        * deleteURL(api_dev_key, short_url)
        
        * NOTE: how to prevent abuse: 
                To prevent abuse, we can limit users via their api_dev_key
                
#4. Models:Classes, DB Schema & ER diagrams=====================
        * URL
                * short_url : PK, varchar
                * original_url : varchar
                * createdOn : datetime
                * expiresOn : datetime
                * createdBy : user_id, FK
        * User
                * user_id : PK, varchar
                * name: varchar
                * email: varchar
                * password: varchar (hashed)
                * createdOn : datetime
                * last_login: datetime
                
#5. Draw Basic HLD =============================================

* Encoding Algos
        1. base36 ([a-z ,0-9]) 
        2. base62 ([A-Z, a-z, 0-9]) 
        3. Base64 (if we add â€˜+â€™ and â€˜/â€™)
        4. MD5/ SHA256
* [? ]what should be the length of the short key? 6, 8, or 10 characters?
        * Using base64 encoding, a 6 letters long key would result in 64^6 = ~68.7 billion possible strings
        * Using base64 encoding, an 8 letters long key would result in 64^8 = ~281 trillion possible strings
        * ASSUME(len = 6) With 68.7B unique strings, letâ€™s assume six letter keys would suffice for our system.

* MD5 algorithm as our hash function, itâ€™ll produce a 128-bit hash value.
* After base64 encoding, weâ€™ll get a string having more than 21 characters 
        *(since each base64 character encodes 6 bits of the hash value). 
* Now we only have space for 8 characters per short key, how will we choose our key then? 
        * We can take the first 6 (or 8) letters for the key. This could result in key duplication, to resolve that, we can choose some other characters out of the encoding string or swap some characters.


# How to avoid duplicate entries(by multiple server instances)
        1. Keep generating urls until its unique
        2. Append a unique key to url before encoding it
                * Unique key could be:
                        1. UserID (if exists)
                        2. increasing Counter per machine
        2.1 ISSUE: how do you manage counters on individual machine: overflow/machine failure/addition
                * => Use zookeeper
                        * a centralized service for providing configuration information, naming, synchronization and group services over large clusters in distributed systems. 
                        * The goal is to make these systems easier to manage with improved, more reliable propagation of changes

# 1. Requirement Gathering ======================================
        1.1 Functional Requirements
            
            * Other sevices(like Paytm) can also book seats in same hall
            * Show multiple cities
            * Each theater can have multiple halls
            * Each hall can run 1 movie at 1 time
            * Movies will have multiple shows
            * Customers can search movie by title, language, genre, release date, city.
                => Redirect search reqs to Elastic Search
                * It also works as Analytics Engine
            * Customers can see the theaters as per their filtered search
            * Customers can see seating arrangement of halls & select any city they want
            * Customers can see booked/free tickets
            * Payments - 3P
            * Show movie info
            * Payments - 3P
            * Ensure No two customers can reserve the same seat.

        1.2 NonFunctional Requirements - Usage Patterns(read heavy/CAP tradeoffs)
            
            * Highly Concurrent
            
        1.3 Out of Scope

            * Moive suggestions
            * Give Reviews, Ratings
            * Send ticket my sms/whatsapp/mail
            * Add discount coupon during payment

# Notes: ==================================================== 

* Lock mechanism on seat booking:
    * If he doesnâ€™t book within 10 min, release the seat.

* For Search Queries:
    => Redirect search reqs to Elastic Search
    * It also works as Analytics Engine

* For caching use: Redis or memcached
    * Redis is better choice as its distributed & persistent

* Choice of DB: 
    => use both RDBMS + NoSQL
    * RDMBS: store ACID/static data:
        * movie halls
        * seats
        * cities
        * userInfo
        * => Sharding
        * => Master/Slave for Read/Writes
    * NoSQL : 
        below data is Big data i.e. too much for RDBMS to digest
        so use NoSQL for it
        * movie related info-cast/story/reviews etc
        * => Geo-distributed backups

* Use Kafka queues to send tickets on mail/sms/generate pdfs in ASYNC

* For Recommendation system:
    * Dump all data on HDFS
    * Process with Apache Spark
    * Run Hive queries
    * Build ML models & recommend

* For concurrency:

```s
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
 
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
 
    -- Suppose we intend to reserve three seats (IDs: 54, 55, 56) for ShowID=99 
    Select * From ShowSeat where ShowID=99 && ShowSeatID in (54, 55, 56) && isReserved=0 
 
    -- if the number of rows returned by the above statement is NOT three, we can return failure to the user.
    update ShowSeat table...
    update Booking table ...
 
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
