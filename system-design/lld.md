### Notes

* How to identify **classes, attributes & methods** in system? ‚úÖ‚≠êÔ∏èüî•üòé

* [Ducktyping](https://realpython.com/lessons/duck-typing/)??
  * This term comes from the saying ‚ÄúIf it walks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.‚Äù \(There are [other variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test#History)\).
  * Duck typing is a concept related to **dynamic typing**, where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. When you use duck typing, you do not check types at all. Instead, you check for the presence of a given method or attribute.
* **In python, objects are passed by REFERENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
* **Deployment:**
