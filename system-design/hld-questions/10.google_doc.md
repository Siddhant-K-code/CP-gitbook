#### #6. Detailed HLD ================================================

* **Will Locking work?**
  * \*\*=> NO, \*\*as 100s of people use the doc at the same time
  * \=> We've to use a **lock-free design**
* **Optimistic Concurrency Control:**
  * using
    1. Versioning
    2. Conflict Resolution
* **Sync Strategies**
  1. **Event Passing**
     * character-by-character sync
     * keep track of full file for each user & sync it
     * every change made by user: (CRUD, font change etc) has to be sent as \*\*an event \*\*to all the other people who are editing the doc
     * **==> Google doc uses this✅**
  2. **Differential Sync**
     * similar to `git diff`
     * Just keep the diff's of users & keep sending it to all of them to maintain the sync
     * might be tedious if many people update the same file section
* **Operational Transformation**
