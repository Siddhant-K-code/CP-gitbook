# 1. TinyURL

### Resources

* Amazing similar read: HN: [How does Google Authenticator work?](https://prezu.ca/post/2021-07-30-totp-1/) 🤯

## 1. Requirement Gathering

### Functional Requirements 

* customer Login 
* Given a URL; generate a shorter & unique alias of it: `www.short.ly/abc123 5`
* \[?] length of short url 6
* Expiry/TTL for each short URL 7
* getLongUrl(short_url) 8

### NonFunctional Requirements 

\- Usage Patterns(read heavy/CAP tradeoffs) 

* High Availability (for reads to work)
* High consistency (to avoid duplicate writes) 
* Short ULR should be unique 

### Out of Scope 

* customised short url 
* analytics 
* API support 

## 2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation

### Scale of System

* New URLs per month(write) = 500 M 
* QPS = 500M/(30_24_60\*60) = 200 URLS write per second
* Read:Write = 100:1 24 => #urls read per month = 500M\*100 = 50B 

### Storage size estimation 

* store all ursl for 5 years 
  * \=> Total urls stored in 5 year = 500M_5_12 = 30B 
* size of single stored obj = 500bit 
  * \=> total storage reqd = 30B \* 500 bit = 15 TB 
* CACHING: 
  * assume 80-20 rule: 
    * i.e. 20% of URLs generate 80% of traffic 
    * cache these 20% hot URLs 
    * cache size per second = 20K\*(500bit) = 10MB 
      * \=> cache size per day = 10MB_24_3600 = 100GB 

### Bandwidth Estimate 

* Incoming(write) req = 200 \* 500 bytes = 100 KB/s 
* Outgoing(read) req = 20K \* 500 bytes = 10 MB/s 

## 3. APIs 

* `createURL(api_dev_key, original_url, custom_alias=None, user_id=None, expire_date=None)` 
  * returns short URL string 
* `getLongURL(api_dev_key, short_url,user_id) `
  * returns original LONG url string 
* deleteURL(api_dev_key, short_url) 
* NOTE: how to prevent abuse: 48 To prevent abuse, we can limit users via their `api_dev_key` 

## 4. Models:

* URL 
  * short_url : PK, varchar 
  * original_url : varchar 
  * createdOn : datetime 
  * expiresOn : datetime 
  * createdBy : user_id, FK 
* User 
  * user_id : PK, varchar 
  * name: varchar 
  * email: varchar 
  * password: varchar (hashed) 
  * createdOn : datetime 
  * last_login: datetime 

## LLD: CODE

* [x] LC: [Encode and Decode TinyURL](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Naive Approach" %}


My first solution produces short URLs like `http://tinyurl.com/0`, `http://tinyurl.com/1`, etc, in that order.

```python
class Codec:

    def __init__(self):
        self.urls = []

    def encode(self, longUrl):
        self.urls.append(longUrl)
        return 'http://tinyurl.com/' + str(len(self.urls) - 1)

    def decode(self, shortUrl):
        return self.urls[int(shortUrl.split('/')[-1])]
```

### Disadvantages:



* If I'm asked to **encode the same long URL several times**, it will get several entries. That wastes codes and memory.
* People can find out how many URLs have already been encoded. Not sure I want them to know.
* People might try to get special numbers by spamming me with repeated requests shortly before their desired number comes up.
* Only using digits means the codes can grow unnecessarily large. Only offers a million codes with length 6 (or smaller). Using six digits or lower or upper case letters would offer (10+26\*2)^6 = 56,800,235,584 codes with length 6.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Efficient Approach" %}
The following solution doesn't have these problems. It produces short URLs like `http://tinyurl.com/`**`KtLa2U`**, using a **random code of six digits or letters**. 

If a long URL is already known, the existing short URL is used and no new entry is generated.



```python
'''
http://tinyurl.com/abcd123 -> “http://www.google.com”
'''
import string,random

class Codec:
    
    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + '0123456789'
    tiny_url_prefix = 'http://tinyurl.com/'
    MAX_LEN = 6

    def __init__(self):
        self.long2short = {}    # 'http://www.google.com' -> 'abc123'
        self.short2long = {}    # 'abc123' -> 'http://www.google.com'

    def encode(self, longUrl):
        
        # so that duplicate longUrls give same hash every time
        while longUrl not in self.long2short.keys():
            hash_val = ''.join(random.choice(Codec.alphabet) for _ in range(Codec.MAX_LEN))
            if hash_val not in self.short2long.keys():  
                self.short2long[hash_val] = longUrl
                self.long2short[longUrl] = hash_val
        
        return Codec.tiny_url_prefix + self.long2short[longUrl]
        
    def decode(self, shortUrl):
        # No key exception : handled
        prefix = shortUrl.split('/')[-1]
        return self.short2long.get(prefix)
    

codec = Codec()
print(codec.encode('http://www.google.com'))

short = codec.encode('http://www.google.com')
print(codec.decode(short))  # http://www.google.com
```



### Guarantees Unique ShortURL:

* It's possible that a randomly generated code has already been generated before. 
* In that case, another random code is generated instead. 
* Repeat until we have a code that's not already in use. 
* **How long can this take?** 
  * Well, even if we get up to using half of the code space, which is a whopping (62^6)/2 = 28,400,117,792 entries, then each code has a 50% chance of not having appeared yet. 
  * So the expected/**average number of attempts is 2**, and for example only one in a billion URLs takes more than 30 attempts. 
  * And if we ever get to an even larger number of entries and this does become a problem, then we **can just use length 7.** We'd need to anyway, as we'd be running out of available codes.

### Encoding Approaches

* Encoding Algos 
  * 1\. base36 (\[a-z ,0-9]) 
  * 2\. base62 (\[A-Z, a-z, 0-9]) 
  * 3\. Base64 (if we add ‘+’ and ‘/’) 
  * 4\. MD5/ SHA256
* \[?]what should be the length of the short key? 6, 8, or 10 characters? 
  * Using base64 encoding, a 6 letters long key would result in 64^6 = \~68.7 billion possible strings 
  * Using base64 encoding, an 8 letters long key would result in 64^8 = \~281 trillion possible strings 
  * ASSUME(len = 6) With 68.7B unique strings, let’s assume six letter keys would suffice for our system.
* MD5 algorithm as our hash function, it’ll produce a 128-bit hash value.
* After base64 encoding, we’ll get a string having more than 21 characters 
  * (since each base64 character encodes 6 bits of the hash value).
* Now we only have space for 8 characters per short key, how will we choose our key then? 
* We can take the first 6 (or 8) letters for the key. This could result in key duplication, to resolve that, we can choose some other characters out of the encoding string or swap some characters.

### How to avoid duplicate entries(by multiple server instances)

1. Keep generating urls until its unique 
2. Append a unique key to url before encoding it 
   1. Unique key could be: 
      1. UserID (if exists) 
      2. increasing Counter per machine 90 
3. ISSUE: how do you manage counters on individual machine: overflow/machine failure/addition

* \=> Use zookeeper 
  * a centralized service for providing configuration information, naming, synchronization and group services over large clusters in distributed systems. 
  * The goal is to make these systems easier to manage with improved, more reliable propagation of changes
