#1. Requirement Gathering ======================================
        1.1 Functional Requirements
                * Reserve a parking spot
                * Receive a ticket/receipt
                * Make payment
                * 3 Types of parking spots: Compact, Regular, large
                * Flat pricing for each spot, per hour 
        1.2 NonFunctional Requirements 
                * High consistency (no 2 people should reserve same spot)
                        * Go for Strong Consistency (rather than Eventual Consitency)
                        * Hence RDBMS (ACID transactions)
                * Reads >>> Writes
        1.3 Out of Scope
                * In-house payment system
#2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation ============================
        2.1 Scale of System
                * 10 floors per garage, 200 spots per floors => 2000 spots
                        * => Not applicable for big data
        2.2 Storage size estimation
#3. APIs =======================================================
        3.1 External Endpoints:
                * POST /create_account
                        * Params: email, pwd(hashed), name, (3rd party login)
                * POST /reserve
                        * Params: garage_id, start_time, end_time
                        * Returns: reservation_id, spot_id
                * /payment => 3-rd party
                        * Params: reservation_id
                        * [?] to be called internally by /reserve
                * POST /cancel
                        * Params: reservation_id
        3.2 Internal Endpoints:
                * /calculate_payment/:reservation_id
                * /check_free_spots
                        * Has logic if smaller vehicles can fit into one large spot
                * /allocate_spot
                        * Params: garage_id, vehicle_type, time

#4. Models : Classes, DB Schema & ER diagrams=====================
        * Reservations
                * id : PK, serial
                * garage_id: FK, int
                * spot_id: FK, int
                * start: int
                * end: int
                * paid: boolean
        * Garage
                * id: PK, serial
                * zipcode: varchar
                * rate_compact: decimal
                * rate_regular: decimal
                * rate_large: decimal
        * Spots
                * id: PK, serial
                * garage_id: FK, int
                * vehicle_type: ENUM
                * status: ENUM
        * Users
                * id: PK, serial
                * email: varchar
                * password: varchar(NOTE: this is probably SHA-256 hashed)
                * name: varchar
        * Vehicles
                * id: PK, serial
                * user_id: FK, int
                * license: varchar
                * vehicle_type: ENUM
