# Slack @coinbase

* [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/slack-NTe7cDhHvX3AWfF7k9quyw)

#### #1. Requirement Gathering ======================================

#### 1.1 Functional Requirements

* Use should be able to send & receive chat messages from his/her contacts who are also on slack
* Group chat (upto 250 members) ??
* Track messages status: sent/delivered/read ??
  * \=> Slack shows notification if msg was unable to send
* Account registration using mail/phone
* Push Notifications: when the user is offline- send notifications for new msgs
* When the use comes online; he should be able to see all new msgs
* Adding support for media files(img.video.audio)
* E2E encryption

#### 1.2 NonFunctional Requirements - Usage Patterns(read heavy/CAP tradeoffs)

* High availability
* Fault Tolerant
* Consistency
* Scalable
* Minimum latency (real-time chat experience)
* Durability(keep chat history)

#### 1.3 Out of Scope

* Suppor for Slack-web ?
* Analytics/Monitoring

#### #2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation ============================

#### 2.1 Scale of System

* DAU = 500M
* 1 user sends 100 msgs daily
* \==> 50B msgs per day

#### 2.2 Storage size estimation

* size of 1 msg = 100bytes
  * \=> total size = 20B\*100 byte = 2TB/day
    * \=> 5PB for 5 years

#### 2.3 Bandwidth estimation(read+write)

* incoming & outgoing data = 2TB/(24\*3600) = 25MB/s

#### #3. APIs =======================================================

* **1-to-1 Chat**
  * `createAccount(API_key, use_id, name, email...)`
  * `validateAccount(API_key, user_id, validation_code)`
  * `initiateDirectChatSession(API_key, sender_id, receiver_id, handshake_info)`
    * \=> for initial handshake
  * `sendMessage(API_key, session_id, msg_type, msg)`
    * `Returns msg_id`
  * `getMessageStatus(API_key, message_id)`
  * `readNewMessage(API_key,session_id, last_msg_id)`
    * `last_msg_id`to be used as **pointer** to separate b/w read & not-read msgs
* **Group chats**
*
  * `createGrop(API_key, group_id, group_name, `**`admin, [members]`**`)`
  * `addUserToGroup(API_Key, group_id, user_id,admin_id)`
  * `removeUserFromGroup(API_Key, group_id, user_id,admin_id)`
  * `promoteMemberToGroup(API_key,group_id,user_id)`

#### #4. Models:Classes, DB Schema & ER diagrams=====================

#### 4.1 Tables Schemas

* **User**
  * user\_id: PK
  * name
  * email
  * ...
* **Group**
  * groupID: PK
  * name
  * created\_time
  * member\_count
* **GroupMembership**
  * groupID: **PK**
  * userID: **SK(Secondary Key)**
  * creation\_time : datetime
  * user\_type: ADMIN,MEMBER
* **Sessions**
  * session\_id : PK
  * user\_id
  * appserver\_id
  * last\_activity
  * timestamp

#### 4.2 DBs choices(NoSQL/SQL)

* **How to shard GroupMembership table**
  * \*\*Option#1: \*\*Shard by groupID => Called **Local Index**
    * \=> then membership info will be spread across all the shards to which user belongs
  * \*\*Option#2: \*\*Shard by userID(**SK**)=> Called **Global Index**
    * \=> group info will be spread
  * **WHich one to choose:**
    * it seems to me that **creating groups and updating their membership is potentially less frequent** than the ongoing msgs posted into the group chats by users.
    * So the Session and Fanout service benefits **more from a global index on userID**.
    * Users who create/update a group will necessarily have to wait for scatter/gather across partitions but this is less frequent than the msg posts occurring within the group chats.

#### #5. Draw 'Basic HLD'=============================================

### #WebSockets

* **USE CASE: chatting @whatsapp**
* In the beginning; a **Handshake** connection(usually **HTTP**) is established b/w client & server
* After this; the client & server communicate through a **bi-directional long-lived TCP connection**
* **PROS:**
  * bidirecional low latency communication
  * Reduced overhead of HTTP requests
* **CONS:**
  * Clients are responsible for connections
  * Scalability challanges

**Hystrix:**

* \=> Hystrix is a\*\* latency and fault tolerance library\*\* designed to isolate points of access to remote systems, services and 3rd party libraries
* Advantages:
  * Stop cascading failures i.e. reject the request if it cant be handled
  * Realtime **monitoring** of configurations changes
  * Concurrency aware request caching
  * Automated batching through request collapsing
* IE. If a micro service is failing then return the default response and wait until it recovers.

#### 1. Gateway Service

* Responsible for creating \*\*websocket connection \*\*b/w app server & user
* Makes all the API calls to other services as per the user's request

#### 2. Sessions Service

* stores info: which client is connected to which server
* When clientA sends a msg to clientB:
  * clientA sends msg to geteway\_service
  * gateway\_service is pretty dumb(doesnt have inofo on usr's session)
  * gateway\_service passes this req to sessionService
  * session services returns with the details of clientB
  * then gateway service sends that msg to client B
* **+--> Enters WebSockets**

#### 3. UserActivity Service

* takes care of last seen/typing....
* polling/webSockets

#### 4. Group Service

* How does group msging work?
* Fanout sevies asks group srervice for all group data
* then it fans out msgs to all the members
* **DO: batch\_processing /limit the number of users**

#### **5. Someone's typing...**

* typing indicator was triggered on the first keystroke and repeated as more keystrokes occurred.
* If no keystrokes were registered after 10 seconds, the indicator would no longer be displayed. Either you were typing, or you weren’t.
* **If a user stops typing for five seconds, Slack removes the “person is typing” indicator.**
* So when user starts typing update your database and set isTyping true.
* Dont forget to check if isTyping set to true so it will not update every time user presses the key
*   \*\*EVENT is \*\*Implement using a \*\*pub/sub \*\*trigger

    ```
    {
      "isTyping":true,
      "fromDeviceToken": "xxxx",
      "timestamp": 12345
    }
    ```
* \*\*ISSUE: \*\*If user A **connection is lost during typin**g then the status will be always remain true until he resumes the connection. To solve this problem you can have one DateTime field in your firebase object
