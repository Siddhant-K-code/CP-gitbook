```
#1. Requirement Gathering ======================================
        1.1 Functional Requirements

            * Registered users can create campaigns to fund their cause.
            * Registered users can view a campaign by campaign ID
            * Registered users can collect money against a campaign
            * Registered users could contribute to a campaign based on campaign ID
            * Once a day we flush the collected money into the creator’s account

        1.2 NonFunctional Requirements - Usage Patterns/Tradeoffs

            * Low latency
            * Durability changes made to the campaigns or newly created campaign should not be lost
            * Eventual consistency
            * It is a growing system

        1.3 Out of Scope
            * User registration
            * Analytics
            * Recommendation
            * Search
            * Guest flow

#2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation ============================
        2.1 Scale of System
            * Total Active users: 50M
            * New users added daily: 50K (as 'growing system')
            * CAMPAIGN CREATION:
                1 user creates 5 campaigns => 5*50 => 250M campaigns
            * CAMPAIGN VIEWING:
                5M view capaigns daily => 5M/(24*3600) => 60 cmps/sec
            * => Hence, Load on the system isnt much

        2.2 Storage size estimation
            * SKIPPED (nothing much of storage here)

#3. APIs =======================================================
        * createCampaign(userId, String campaignName, CampaignDetails campaignDetails) 
            → returns campaignId of the created campaign

        * getCampaignDetails(userId, campaignId) 
            → Returns CamapignDetails of the given camapignId

        * pay(userId, CampaignId, PaymentDetails paymentDetails) 
            → return a boolean if the payment was successful or not also updates the total collected amount against the campaign

#4. Models:Classes, DB Schema & ER diagrams=====================
    * SKIPPED

#5. Draw Basic HLD =============================================
    * Campaign Creator Service
    * Campaign Viewer Service

#6. EVOLVE HLD to scale & indepth discussion of components =====
    Add/disucss on these optimisations:
    * Load balancer - which is entry point to our website
    * Gateway -- which would be responsible for filtering requests and authentication and authorization
    * Service discovery --- Would be responsible for providing service end points to internal services and also load balancing internally
    * Caching
