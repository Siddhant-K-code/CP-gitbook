# 1. Requirement Gathering ======================================
        1.1 Functional Requirements
            
            * Other sevices(like Paytm) can also book seats in same hall
            * Show multiple cities
            * Each theater can have multiple halls
            * Each hall can run 1 movie at 1 time
            * Movies will have multiple shows
            * Customers can search movie by title, language, genre, release date, city.
                => Redirect search reqs to Elastic Search
                * It also works as Analytics Engine
            * Customers can see the theaters as per their filtered search
            * Customers can see seating arrangement of halls & select any city they want
            * Customers can see booked/free tickets
            * Payments - 3P
            * Show movie info
            * Ensure No two customers can reserve the same seat.

        1.2 NonFunctional Requirements - Usage Patterns(read heavy/CAP tradeoffs)
            
            * Highly Concurrent
            
        1.3 Out of Scope

            * Moive suggestions
            * Give Reviews, Ratings
            * Send ticket my sms/whatsapp/mail
            * Add discount coupon during payment
# 2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation ============================
        2.1 Scale of System
        2.2 Storage size estimation
# 3. APIs =======================================================
# 4. Models:Classes, DB Schema & ER diagrams=====================

# Notes: ==================================================== 

* Lock mechanism on seat booking:
    * If he doesnâ€™t book within 10 min, release the seat.

* For Search Queries:
    => Redirect search reqs to Elastic Search
    * It also works as Analytics Engine

* For caching use: Redis or memcached
    * Redis is better choice as its distributed & persistent

* Choice of DB: 
    => use both RDBMS + NoSQL
    * RDMBS: store ACID/static data:
        * movie halls
        * seats
        * cities
        * userInfo
        * => Sharding
        * => Master/Slave for Read/Writes
    * NoSQL : 
        below data is Big data i.e. too much for RDBMS to digest
        so use NoSQL for it
        * movie related info-cast/story/reviews etc
        * => Geo-distributed backups

* Use Kafka queues to send tickets on mail/sms/generate pdfs in ASYNC

* For Recommendation system:
    * Dump all data on HDFS
    * Process with Apache Spark
    * Run Hive queries
    * Build ML models & recommend

* For concurrency:

```s
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
 
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
 
    -- Suppose we intend to reserve three seats (IDs: 54, 55, 56) for ShowID=99 
    Select * From ShowSeat where ShowID=99 && ShowSeatID in (54, 55, 56) && isReserved=0 
 
    -- if the number of rows returned by the above statement is NOT three, we can return failure to the user.
    update ShowSeat table...
    update Booking table ...
 
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```
