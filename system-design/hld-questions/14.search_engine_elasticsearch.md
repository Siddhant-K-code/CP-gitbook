**1. Crawling:**

* Google servers keep crawling chunks of internet
* while crawing, it keeps \*\*rank \*\*of each page(using **page\_rank**)
  * if more & reputed sites are directing to a site, it has high rank
  * **Damping factor**(e.g. dp = 0.85) for **random access**
    * i.e. 85% of the time crawler will get move to the directed site
    * 15% of the time crawler will jump to **any random page on** **whole internet**

**2. Inverted Indexing**

* Working(below pic)
* puts all this \*\*metadata \*\*in **metadata\_db**
* **Implemented using B-Trees - `O(logN)`**

**3. Querying/Searching**

* Sanitize, filter, stemm, lemmatize the search query to get **query\_keywords**
* **e.g.: Keyword targeting @flipkart üòé**
* **Approaches:**
  1. **Conjunctive Querying -> AND**
     * Performs\*\* AND operation\*\* on all the\*\* `words in query_keywords` \*\*
     * returns only those docs which have all the keywords present in them
  2. \*\*Disjunctive Querying -> UNION \*\*
     * Takes all the document which have **ANY of the keyword present**
     * then performs **UNION** on these docs
     * Then removes **duplicates** from the result
  3. **Conjunctive with Positioning**
     * The order of words in query is also imp!!!
       * E.g: if query is `men in black`
       * And if you dont consider the order of words; you'll also return results for `black in men`üòÇ
     * HOW does it work?
       1. get results of normal **Conjunctive Querying**
       2. filter only those results which have **relative ordering** in place
          * E.g.
            * QUERY: men-0, in-1, black-2
            * Valid results: men-12, in-100, black-150‚úÖ
            * Invalid results: men-100, in-20, black-5‚ùå
