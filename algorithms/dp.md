# DP

## \# Notes 

*  **Approach for DP problem:**  find Recursion **===&gt;** Memoize it **===&gt;** \(optional\) Top-Down OR matrix
* Using **MEMO** in python: \(using **dict**-  constant lookup time\)

```python
MEMO = {}
# ... use memo inside recur fn
if (a,b,c) in MEMO: return MEMO[(a,b,c)]
# find res & set in MEMO
MEMO[(a,b,c)] = res
```

* Memoization vs Top-Down: \(_both have same space & time complexities_\)
  * **Recursion+Memoization** is easy to think & code.**should be your goto** approach for all DP ques.
    * in Rarest of rare cases; it might lead to _recursive stack overflow err_
  * **Top-Down:** nobody can write it w/o recursive. Avoid for new/unseen problems
    * If recursion+memo gives stack-overflow err, use Top-Down!
